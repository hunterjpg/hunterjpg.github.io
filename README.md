[## A (semi) interactive (and incomplete) history of web design!](https://smeasly.github.io)

## About This Project
This project was originally an assignment for an IT diploma program - How does this fit into IT? Well, because it's fun.
This is basically a showcase of some of the web designs that I appreciate, and some that I don't.
I want to expand this as a personal side project for fun, and hopefully find a better hosting solution (myself or a service that supports more than static pages)

## Pages
 - **Main Index**
 Modern, flat web design - My approximation of what we see today
 - **Neoscape Navigator**
 Your portal into the past
 - **Geoscape**
 The kitschy design of the 90s to the early 2000s
 - **Two-Point-Oh**
 The early attempts at *sleek and future-forward* design
 - **The Future...**
 A taste of what the *terrifying* future may hold

## Attributions and Sources
I did not create - from scratch - everything in these pages. Especially the images
I've tried to collect all the sources used during this project - from source markup to resources.
Many of these are also linked directly in the pages - if you want to go looking :)

#### Attributions - Inspiration
I collected a lot of inspiration for this, which I link to within the pages.
I'll try to list actual resources for assets and markup that I borrowed here as I remember them:
###### Assets and Source
 - I created a few of the images myself, but many of them I stole straight from the depths of [GifCities](https://gifcities.org) and many more from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org)
 - The interface UI [Icons](https://archive.org/details/github.com-grassmunk-Chicago95_Extras_-_2021-02-23_17-07-06) from [The Chigago95 XFCE spin](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/tree/master)
 - The Neoscape UI, though not in whole, was from [netscape.html - A simple netscape UI in HTML](https://gist.github.com/opaeoh/5fcdadb5bb2f701c7a5a94d79f97f856) by [opaeoh](https://github.com/opaeoh)
